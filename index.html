        <p>IBM's Data Science Experience is an enterprise-grade business
        analytics platform. It enables data scientists to collaborate and
        leverage cloud computing to understand big data through statistical
        and machine learning algorithms. WYC Technology conducts routine IT
        security assessments of new cloud offerings to ensure its clients'
        data are safe. Within a short period of inspection, we identified a
        major security flaw that put <b>hundreds of terabytes of customer
        data</b> at stake. We worked directly with IBM's security team to
        issue a correction within just two weeks.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>Many companies fret about what technologies they should use to
        build their custom web software because of the dizzying amount of
        choices in the ecosystem. To the uninitiated, it's a keyword soup of
        terms like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, ReactJS, Node.js, AngularJS, and
        Elixir. However, it doesn't have to be complicated. If you care most
        about spending your time actually talking to customers, then just
        build it in Django or Rails.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>Sometimes, it's actually not best to use a mainstream web
        framework when starting new development or refactoring an existing
        project. It's important to understand what web frameworks are
        typically good at, and where they fall short.
