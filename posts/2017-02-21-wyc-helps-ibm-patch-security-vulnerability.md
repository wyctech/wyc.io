<p>IBM's Data Science Experience is an enterprise-grade business
analytics platform. It enables data scientists to collaborate and
leverage cloud computing to understand big data through statistical and
machine learning algorithms. WYC Technology conducts routine IT
security assessments of new cloud offerings to ensure its clients' data
are safe. Within a short period of inspection, we identified a major
security flaw that put <b>hundreds of terabytes of customer data</b>
at stake. We worked directly with IBM's security team to issue a
correction within just two weeks.</p>
