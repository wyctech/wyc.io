<p>Writing quality custom software for a web application can quickly get very
expensive because the relevant skills are in high demand. Everyone wants to
leverage the Internet's low distribution costs to scale their business. A
Content Management System (CMS) is software primarily designed to fulfill
content publishing needs: blogs, news websites, and newsletters. However,
through a rich ecosystem of plugins for free CMS software like Wordpress and
Drupal, people have built very successful ecommerce and subscription businesses
while paying for <i>very little</i> custom programming. When does this approach
work well, and when does it fall short?
